# Degree-Converter1
  The purpose of this lab is to create a Java program that takes in fahreinheit degrees and change them into celcius degrees and outputs the results to the console and into a text file. We are given a text file that has our data inside. The data consists of numbers that stands for our fahreinheit degree values. 
  The first task to open our file. To open that file, we create a scanner object that will get our input from the text file we were given. Once we create the file scanner, we create an ArrayList that will hold our first hand of data from the file, which is our degree values in fahreinheit. After we add our fahreinheit values from the .txt file, we create another ArrayList to hold our converted data. After we finish that task, we need to convert fahreinheit values to celcius values and store them in the second ArrayList we created. 
  The next task we did is to create a file and store our fahreinheit and celcius values inside it in a table format. Then, we close both of our files to prevent possible file corruption. The next and last thing we need to do is to create a hash map that will get the data we added inside the file and will output the table to the console in the same format. 
  This project helped me learn many things and practice them. I learned how to get input from a file and output to a file. I learned how to create a hashmap, store values inside it, and do tasks with it. I could improve my code by learning about File I/O further which could possible make my code cleaner and easier to understand.
